Pesduo code the app using bullets points

your code needs to be able to take input from command 
your code must read the input 
After reading your input the code must search
your code should be able to search through a database 
your code should be able to pull information from database
your code should display the information on cli

first thing should most likely be done is use process.argv to take input
next there must be some sort of database to pull data from like ajax and omdb
and finally I think a console.log should be able to print the information
